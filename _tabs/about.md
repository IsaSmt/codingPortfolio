Hi, I'm Isabel Simmet, a passionate and detail-oriented student at the University of Applied Sciences Munich with a strong focus on building practical and efficient software solutions.

My journey into technology is driven by a fascination with automating complex processes and creating tools that simplify people's lives. I enjoy diving deep into the Python ecosystem and using modern frameworks like Streamlit to build interactive and user-friendly web applications.

My academic and personal projects have given me hands-on experience with:
- **Web Application Development:** Creating full-stack applications with Python, Streamlit, and various APIs.
- **Automation:** Scripting workflows to reduce manual effort, particularly using the Google Workspace API suite (Drive, Forms, Sheets).
- **Version Control:** Managing codebases and collaborating effectively using Git and platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging problems. My goal is to leverage my skills to create software that is not only functional but also intuitive and impactful.
